1) Make a copy of your problem set document, and add """"- revision"""" to the end of the title.
2) Improve your answers and code submissions. Your answers must be your own and cannot be copied and pasted from solutions or peers' work. Your code must be written entirely by you - note that this means you should not be copying and pasting *any* code.
